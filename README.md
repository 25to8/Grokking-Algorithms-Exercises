# Grokking Algorithms Exercises
I was a dummy in university, math was not interesting too, but time changes. 
I'm fixing this issue since today because don't wanna be an outsider. 
Fortunately, there is an awesome book for dummy guys like me, called
[Grokking Algorithms](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Grokking-Algorithms-illustrated-programmers-curious/dp/1617292230/ref=asc_df_1617292230/?tag=googshopuk-21&linkCode=df0&hvadid=310819191513&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=5682715451128672563&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=2826&hvtargid=pla-436862069177&psc=1&th=1&psc=1). Highly recommended.
Each algorithm is written on Golang and JavaScript because 
it's my favorite stack.

## Run tests
Run `make run-tests` to launch tests of all algorithms on both programming languages.
