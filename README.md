# Grokking Algorithms Exercises
There is an awesome book for dummy guys like me, called
[Grokking Algorithms](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Grokking-Algorithms-illustrated-programmers-curious/dp/1617292230/ref=asc_df_1617292230/?tag=googshopuk-21&linkCode=df0&hvadid=310819191513&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=5682715451128672563&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=2826&hvtargid=pla-436862069177&psc=1&th=1&psc=1). Highly recommended!
I structured my own basic knowledge about algorithms and wrote implementations for most common. Each algorithm is written on Golang and JavaScript because it's my favorite stack.

## Run tests
Run `make run-tests` to launch tests of all algorithms on both programming languages.
